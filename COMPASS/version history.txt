(2011)

1.2.17.0 (Wednesday, March 12, 2014)
- ProteinHoarder -> 2.4.5.0
  Two bug fixes. Chymotrypsin digestions were defaulting to brute force search, this is
  because Chymotrypsin cleaves at 'L', but the program was originally converting
  all 'I' to 'L', thus making the digestion incorrect.

  Multiple proteases support was originally doing sequential digetsions of the the same
  peptide population. It is now doing digestion on different populations.

1.2.12.0 (Monday, December 9, 2013)
- FdrOptimizer -> 2.0.3.0
  Added maximaul ppm error input for capping the maximum ppm error allowed.
  Added back * to user modifications
  Went back to slower, but more accurate 2D FDR calculation.

1.2.11.0 (Tuesday, November 12, 2013)
- Procyon -> 0.0.1.0
  Added Procyon to Compass

1.2.9.0 (Thursday, October 3, 2013)
- FdrOptimizer -> 2.0.0.0
  Combined all the FDR optimizers into one new program.
  Made the unique peptide generation a user choice, will also be more conservative

- Compass
  Moved the old FDRs into a separate tool strip

1.2.8.0 (Wednesday, August 18, 2013)
- TagQuant -> 1.4.0.0
  Fixed noise band cap bug in which noise band PC values were 100 times to large

- Phosphinator -> 1.0.0.0
  Made compatible with new TagQuant outputs.

1.2.7.0 (Thursday, August 8, 2013)
- TagQuant -> 1.1.0.0
  Completely reworked tag quant

1.2.6.0 (Thursday, August 8, 2013)
- Lotor -> 1.0.0.0
  Added program LOcalize TO Residue (Lotor) for PTM localization.

- Replace Matrix package CSML with MathNet.Numerics

1.2.5.0 (Tuesday, August 6, 2013)
- Protein Hoarder -> 2.4.1.0
  New algorithm for finding subsumable protein groups greatly speeds up the slowest
  step of the program.

1.2.4.0 (Monday, August 5, 2013)
- Protein Hoarder -> 2.4.0.0
  Enabled semi-digestion searches
  If the digestion method of mapping fails to find every peptide, it will automatically
  switch to a brute force string search on the remaining unmapped peptides. 

1.2.3.0 (Thursday, July 11, 2013)
- DTA Generator Updated -> 1.0.2.0
  Reenabled logging of precursor information in the text log file

1.2.2.0 (Friday, March 22, 2013)
- DTA Generators Updated -> 1.0.1.0
  Would erroneously grab the precursor m/z from the previous MS1 instead of the
  MS1 scan that actually triggered the MS/MS scan.

1.2.1.0 (Tuesday, Feburary 12, 2013)
- FDR Optimizer Updated
  Wasn't handling dual modified sites correctly (i.e. TMT and Acetyl on the same lysine)

1.2.0.0 (Monday, September 10, 2012)
- Protein Hoarder -> 2.3.0.0
  Streamelined the results for uniprot-based databases to quickly filter out the
  Uniprot ID and Gene Names. General improvements as well.

  Removed Protein Herder and Protein Taq Quant from the choices of nodes since they
  are replaced by Protein Hoarder.

1.1.9.0 (Thursday, August 2, 2012)
- Protein Hoarder -> 2.2.5.0
  Error in when the largest peptide identified was also an N-terminal peptide, 
  the digestion algorithm would miss it.

1.1.7.0 (Thursday, February 23, 2012)
- Error in Non-batch High Res FDR Optimizer in which it was not correctly getting the
  right MS1 scans for each MS/MS peptide hit. 

1.1.6.2 (Saturday, January 28, 2012)
- DTA generator would perform really slowly if there weren't any MS1 scans.
  Fixed it by checking for all the MS1 scans at the beginning and storing them
  in a time-saving array for quick look ups.

1.1.6.1 (Friday, January 06, 2012)
- Protein Hoarder -> 2.2.4.0
  Fixed a bug in which the peptide start and stop residues would not 
  be mapped to the representative protein.

1.1.5.3 (Tuesday, November 22, 2011)
- Protein Hoarder -> 2.2.3.1
  Included outputs to spit out the number of PSMs and unique
  peptide sequences for each protein group based on the experiment
  ids.

1.1.4.0 (Thursday, November 17, 2011)
- Protein Hoarder -> 2.2.2.0
  Included interference filtering for quantitation values
  to exclude PSM that have too much interference in their
  isolation window (Original Quant Mode)

1.1.3.0 (Thursday, November 10, 2011)
- Protein Hoarder -> 2.2.1.0
  Refactored the code to dramtically decreases memory 
  consumption. It also now includes protein quantitation
  module so that Protein Tag Quant is no longer needed.
  Includes experimental details in which proteins can be
  grouped acrossed experiments but individual quantitation is
  determined on a experiment-by-experiment basis.

1.1.2.0 (Caturday!, September 17, 2011)
- Protein Hoarder -> 2.1.1.0
  Fixed a bug in which Proteins that contain the amino acid
  character 'X' would not be digested correctly. It now trims
  all 'X's from the N-term and C-Term of the protein before
  digestion.

1.1.1.0 (Monday, August 29, 2011)
- Protein Hoarder improvements. Can read in any omssa
  csv file now and correctly parses it. 

1.1.0.1 (Monday, August 15, 2011)
- Added a new program called "Protein Hoarder" which
  will replace protein herder. This version is considerably
  faster than protein herder.

1.0.5.1 (Wednesday, August 10, 2011)
- Forces application to run in 32-bit mode no matter
  the operating system capacity.

1.0.4.5 (Tuesday, August 09, 2011)
- TagQuant nows records the noiseband intensity if a
  certain reporter tag cannot be found.

1.0.4.4 (Monday, April 18, 2011)

  so the file-extension can be read correctly.

1.0.4.3 (Monday, April 4, 2011)

  to DTA Generator, FDR Optimizer, and Batch FDR 
  Optimizer.

1.0.3.3 (Friday, January 7, 2011)
- Updated citation and link in about box.

1.0.3.2 (Thursday, January 6, 2011)

- Added taxids.txt file (configurable list of 
  taxonomy IDs for limiting OMSSA searches).
- Updated about box.

  in OMSSA Navigator.
- Added support for dragging-and-dropping/browsing 
  for OMSSA modification .xml files.
- Fixed minor bug in FDR Optimizers: q-values were 
  not being output with enough precision. For the 
  batch versions, this could lead to slightly 
  incorrect numbers of identifications.

1.0.2.7 (Tuesday, January 4, 2011)
- Added support for multi-part databases to OMSSA 
  Navigator.

1.0.2.6 (Tuesday, December 21, 2010)

  filepaths with escaped quotes rather than short 
  (8.3) filepaths.

- Fixed bug in DTA Generator where only two decimal 
  places were being used for precursors.

1.0.2.4 (Thursday, December 16, 2010)

  without making temporary copies.
- Fixed bug where output folder was ignored in OMSSA 
  Navigator.

- Fixed logic for recognizing a valid database in 
  OMSSA Navigator.

1.0.0.1 (Friday, December 3, 2010)
